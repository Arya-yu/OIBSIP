              Edson Arantes do Nascimento (23 October 1940 – 29 December 2022),
              better known by his nickname Pelé, was a Brazilian professional
              footballer who played as a forward. Regarded as one of the
              greatest players of all time and labelled "the greatest" by FIFA,
              he was among the most successful and popular sports figures of the
              20th century. In 1999, he was named Athlete of the Century by the
              International Olympic Committee and was included in the Time list
              of the 100 most important people of the 20th century. In 2000,
              Pelé was voted World Player of the Century by the International
              Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS) and was one of
              the two joint winners of the FIFA Player of the Century. His 1,279
              goals in 1,363 games, which includes friendlies, is recognised as
              a Guinness World Record.
